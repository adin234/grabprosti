                                <p>This study aims to create a mobile application that will integrate lodging and transportation booking to the usual app dating experience. This integration will save logs to keep the users secured and accounted for. These logs can be checked in case of emergency and will help in pointing out where a user went and the person he/she is with during that time.</p>

                                <p>With Internet and Smartphones taking over the way we live today, a lot of things changed. With the emergence of the smartphone, App Dating was introduced in 2003 (Gates, Hoyt, Wakefield, Stewart, & Turner, 2015) and together with Online dating introduced us to new ways of connecting and hanging out with other people. App dating takes advantage of the mobile phone's capabilities such as GPS and suggests a match using these data (ie. user's current location). The most known app of this kind is Tinder which was launched in the fall of 2012. Although, there were no police reports that links Tinder directly to crime, there are a lot of Tinder dates that often go wrong which lowers the approval rating of app dating to other prospective users. In this study, a mobile dating application will be created that has a log of transactions on matching, transportation, and accommodation for the users to have a safe correspondence.</p>
